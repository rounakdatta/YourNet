## Introduction

YourNet is a community-run Decentralized social networking platform, where your information will really be yours! Here users have the complete control over how they intend to share their personal content.


### Motivation: What's wrong with the currently prevalent Social platforms?


TLDR;

- Privacy and security
- Biased content and services
- Extensive monitoring
- Reckless use of user's data for self-benefits
- Single point of failure
- Lack of knowledge of behind the scenes
- Requirement of lots of trust

**Slightly detailed description**

The primary concern is privacy and security. More than 25% of total world population uses proprietary Social Media platforms which manipulate the sensitive data of their users for their own profits.

Over the time, these platforms have turned into a marketing and monetization businesses with little or no consideration towards the actual benefits of social media.

The users of these platforms have absolutely no control on how their personal information or content is going to be used.

As we are all aware, all the currently popular platforms are thriving by using sophisticated learning algorithms on the loads of user data they collect, and the real owners of the data (i.e. the users) are never ever renumerated for the valuable data they generate.

All of our behavior and activities are being logged and utilized by these companies to come up with better strategies to excel in their bussiness. Even there's no guarantee that these companies aren't tapping into your personal chats for self-benefits.

The content that we see in our News Feeds is highly selective and adjusted for financial benefits. Every now and then there are news and studies claiming biased treatment by these companies to different contents.

Finally, we have to **trust** the platform owners for all our interactions with the platforms. These platforms are just like black-boxes. At a basic level, we just provide inputs and get the outputs displayed to our screens. We never know if the content and servies being delivered are legible because we don't know what's happening behind the scenes. Moreover, we have to trust that our data and content is safe and permanent. What if some day they start to charge you ridiculously high amounts for services they offer, or they crash and all your useful information is lost?


### Vision: What YourNet is intended to be?

YourNet will be an attempt to create a platform which will just be a "Social networking platform" in truest sense and nothing else. It is intended to be designed and driven by the community, for the community.

This project is not an attempt to create another ICO in this so-called crypto-bubble, rather the project is aimed at providing the benefits of a decentralized architecture and modern technologies to the community in a transparent and unanimous way.


### What makes YourNet truly "yours"?

- **You decide the product:** The best part of the project is the Open Source nature, meaning anyone can contribute to it and the community will be responsible for deciding what features to implement and what not.

- **YourNet is transparent**, everything from the code to the documents will be present online. So you always know what a button does "behind the scenes", why and how the content is being displayed to you.

- At YourNet **you have the control** over how your content and information is shared. And in long run, we even plan to develop features (if community agrees) to allow share their generated data on will for academic or proprietary purposes, and be adequately compensated in return.

## Features

Initially, the project is aimed to have very minimal features of a social platform - "**Find, post and connect**".

Users will have capability to control access and visiblity of their content.

The long run features to implement will be decided unanimously by the community, once YourNet has considerable amount of users. Some of the possible ideas are:

- Direct and Group chats having end to end encryption
- Reward system for user generating valuable content based on appreciation by the community.
- Ability to share your data for different academic or proprietary purposes and get compensated accordingly.


## Phases

- [ ] Feasiblity analysis
- [ ] Preparation of intial design architecture for minmal working platform
- [ ] Prototyping of different features and segments
- [ ] Concrete design for the basic platform
- [ ] Inviting users to test out the basic platform
- [ ] Discussion and design of Advanced features, which include
    + Chats
    + Reward System for content
    + Renumeration for sharing data
    + Other potential features agreed upon by the community
