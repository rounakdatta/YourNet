## Introduction

YourNet is a community-run Decentralized social networking platform, where your information will really be yours! Here users have the complete control over how they intend to share their personal content.


### Motivation: What's wrong with the currently prevalent Social platforms?

The primary concern is privacy and security. More than 25% of total world population uses proprietary Social Media platforms which manipulate the sensitive data of their users for their own profits.

Over the time, these platforms have turned into a marketing and monetization businesses with little or no consideration towards the actual benefits of social media.

Moreover, the users of these platforms have absolutely no control on how their personal information or content is going to be used.

As we are all aware, all the currently popular platforms are thriving by using sophisticated learning algorithms on the loads of user data they collect, and the real owners of the data (i.e. the users) are never ever renumerated for the valuable data they generate.

**If you still don't feel that's a problem, here are some facts that can change your views:**


### What YourNet is intended to be?

YourNet will be an attempt to create a platform which will just be a "Social networking platform" in truest sense and nothing else.


### What makes YourNet truly "yours"?

- **You decide the product:** The best part of the project is the Open Source nature, meaning anyone can contribute to it and the community will be responsible for deciding what features to implement and what not.

- **YourNet is transparent**, everything from the code to the documents will be present online. So you always know what a button does "behind the scenes", why and how the content is being displayed to you.

- At YourNet **you have the control** over how your content and information is shared. And in long run, we even plan to develop features (if community agrees) to allow share their generated data on will for academic or proprietary purposes, and be adequately compensated in return.

## Features

Initially, the project is aimed to have very minimal features of a social platform - "**Find, post and connect**".

The long run features to implement will be decided unanimously by the community, once YourNet has considerable amount of users.


## Phases

- Feasiblity analysis
- Preparation of intial design architecture for minmal working platform
- Rolling out prototypes
- Discussion and design of Advanced features, which include
    + Renumeration for the data
    + Features selected by the community members
